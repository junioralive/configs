# ish-utils

Welcome to **ish-utils**, the mysterious backstage utility repo used by [ish](https://github.com/theayan/ish) — a glorious mess of AI, UI, and “it works on my machine” magic.

This repo exists for one reason: to keep the main project (`ish`) from spontaneously combusting. It stores a frequently-updated token, runs some secret automation, and probably hosts a few lines of code I forgot to delete. It's not meant for public consumption, serious use, or general understanding.

## ⚠️ Warning

If you're here looking for reusable utils, clean code, or documentation… oh buddy, you’ve taken a wrong turn. This repo is 90% personal hacks, 10% vibes.

## 🧠 Why does this exist?

Because I needed a place to:

- Store a token that updates every hour (yes, *every* hour)
- Test weird ideas I don't want cluttering `ish`
- Confuse future-me

## 🛑 Should you use this?

Absolutely not.

Unless your name is also ISH and you share my exact brain structure, please close this tab and go touch some grass.
